    "### Goals \n",
    "* To provide an exposition of models whose aggregate behavior is the result of market interaction among a large number of agents subject to idiosyncratic shocks. \n",
    "> * This class of models contrast with representative agent models where individual dynamics and uncertainty ciubcude with aggregate dynamics and uncertainty. <br/>\n",
    "> * This exposition is built around the standard growth model of Brock and Mirman(1972) modified to include a role for uninsured idiosyncratic risk and borrowing constraint.\n",
    "* To use such a model to study the quantitative importance of individual risk for aggregate saving. <br/>\n",

However, in a steady state under incomplete markets, tehre is a distribution of agents with different total resources reflecting different histories of labor endowment shocks. \n",
    "* Those with low total resources will continue to be liquidity constrained, whereas those with high total resources will accumulate asstes beyond the constrained level. Aggregation then implies that per capita must necessarily exceed their level under certainty. "

These are used with the asset demand function to obtain a simulated series of assets. The sample mean of this is taken to be $Ea$.Then calculate $r_2$ such that $K(r_2)$ equals $Ea$. If $r_2$ exceeds the rate of time preference, it is replaced by the rate of time preference. Define $r_3=(r_1+r_2)/2$ and calculate $Ea$ corresponding to $r_3$. If $Ea$ exceeds $K(r_3)$, then $r_2$ is replaced by $r_3$, and use bisection again. If $Ea$ is less than $K(r_3)$, then $r_1$ is replaced by $r_3$ then use bisection again. Typically this yields an excellent approximation to the steady state within ten iterations. \n",

    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregate Saving\n",
    "* The differences between the saving rates with an without insurance are quite small for moderate and empirically plausible values of $\\sigma$, $\\rho$, and $\\mu$. Howeverm for for high values of $\\sigma$, $\\rho$, and $\\mu$, the presence of idiosyncratic risk can raise the saving rate quite significantly by up to seven percentage points. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Variabilities \n",
    "* Consumption varies about 50-70 percent as much as income. Saving and assets are much more volatile than income: Saving varies about three times as much as income, and assets vary about twice as much as income. \n",
    "* Risk aversion tends to reduce the variabilities of all these variabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Asset Trading\n",
    "* If $\\mu=3$,$\\sigma=4$ and $\\rho=0.6$, then, by optimally accumulating and depleting assets, consumption variability is cut in half, yielding a welfare benefit of about 14 percent of per capita consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Section Distributions and Inequality Measures\n",
    "* Since long-run distrubutions for an individual coincide with cross-section distrbutions for the population, results for variabilities of individual consumption, income, and assets have immediate implications for cross-section distributions. \n",
    "* There is much less dispersion across households in consumption compared with income and much greater dispersion in wealth compared with income. \n",
    "* Skewness coefficients reveal another aspect of inequality. All of the cross-section distributions are positively skewed (median$<$mean). However, the degree of skewness is less than in the data. "
